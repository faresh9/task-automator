# Transition to n8n

## Why We Moved from Custom API to n8n

Our task automation project originally used a FastAPI backend to handle email processing, meeting scheduling, and task management. While this approach worked, it had several limitations:

1. **Complex Error Handling**: Robust error handling in API code requires significant effort
2. **Integration Challenges**: Each integration (Gmail, Calendar, Trello) needed custom code
3. **Code Maintenance**: Large codebase with many potential points of failure
4. **Deployment Complexity**: API deployment with authentication and security concerns

## Benefits of the n8n Approach

1. **Visual Workflow Building**: No-code/low-code approach makes logic clear and maintainable
2. **Built-in Integrations**: Native connections to Gmail, Calendar, Trello, and more
3. **Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error notifications
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new services or modify workflows
5. **Community Support**: Large community of users sharing workflows and solutions

## Architecture Comparison

### Previous Architecture:
Client → FastAPI Backend → AI Analysis → External Services (Gmail, Calendar, Trello)


### Current Architecture:
Gmail Trigger → n8n Workflow → AI Analysis API → External Services (Calendar, Trello)


## Future Improvements

With n8n in place, we plan to:
1. Add more sophisticated email processing rules
2. Implement multi-channel support (Slack, MS Teams)
3. Add dashboard for workflow monitoring
