System Workflow
1.	User connects their email & calendar.
2.	System fetches meeting requests, schedules them based on availability, and sends reminders.
3.	AI processes emails, categorizes them, and drafts automated replies.
4.	Task management module organizes and prioritizes tasks.
5.	AI continuously learns and improves workflow automation.

Pseudo Code for Key Tasks
1. Email Categorization & Auto-Reply
python
CopyEdit
import openai  
from googleapiclient.discovery import build  

def categorize_email(email_text):  
    response = openai.Completion.create(  
        engine="text-davinci-003",  
        prompt=f"Categorize this email: {email_text}",  
        max_tokens=50  
    )  
    return response.choices[0].text  

service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials='your_credentials')  
emails = service.users().messages().list(userId='me').execute()  
for email in emails['messages']:  
    email_content = service.users().messages().get(userId='me', id=email['id']).execute()  
    category = categorize_email(email_content['snippet'])  
    print(f"Email categorized as: {category}")

2. Meeting Scheduling AI Model
python
CopyEdit
from datetime import datetime  
import random  

def suggest_meeting_time(user_availability):  
    suggested_time = random.choice(user_availability)  
    return suggested_time  

availability = ["2024-03-10 10:00", "2024-03-10 14:00", "2024-03-11 09:00"]  
meeting_time = suggest_meeting_time(availability)  
print(f"Scheduled Meeting Time: {meeting_time}")

3. Task Management API Endpoint (FastAPI Example)
python
CopyEdit
from fastapi import FastAPI  
import pandas as pd  

app = FastAPI()  

@app.get("/tasks")  
def get_tasks():  
    tasks = pd.read_csv("tasks.csv")  
    return tasks.to_dict()
